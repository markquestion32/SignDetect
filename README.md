About
A practical implementation of sign language estimation using an LSTM NN built on TF Keras.

 leverage a keypoint detection model to build a sequence of keypoints which can then be passed to an action detection model to decode sign language! 
 As part of the model building process leverage Tensorflow and Keras to build a deep neural network that leverages LSTM layers to handle the sequence of keypoints.

1. Extract MediaPipe Holistic Keypoints
2. Build a Sign Language model using a Action Detection powered by LSTM layers
3. Predict sign language in real time using video sequences
